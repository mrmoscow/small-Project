1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I Have A Dream

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I Have A Dream

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have a dream

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A song to sing

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To help me cope

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
With anything

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you see the wonder

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Of a fairy tale

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You can take the future

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even if you fail

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I believe in angels

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Something good in everything I see

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I believe in angels

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When I know the time is right for me

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll cross the stream

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have a dream

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I have a dream

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A fantasy

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To help me through

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Reality

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And my destination

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Makes it worth the while

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Pushing through the darkness

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Still another mile

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I believe in angels

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Something good in everything I see

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I believe in angels

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When I know the time is right for me

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll cross the stream

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have a dream

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll cross the stream

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have a dream

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have a dream

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A song to sing

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
To help me cope

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
With anything

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you see the wonder

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Of a fairy tale

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You can take the future

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Even if you fail

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I believe in angels

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Something good in everything I see

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I believe in angels

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When I know the time is right for me

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll cross the stream

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have a dream

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll cross the stream

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have a dream

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have a dream

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have a dream
